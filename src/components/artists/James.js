        You Are Online is a interactive website about engaging with the modern internet. 
        You play the role of the Default User, a grey character working productively at a desk, 
        lost in the world of colours and experiences.
        However, as the User discovers, progress isn't always as great as it seems...

        <ArtistProfile src="../img/james/james.png" alt="James Hancock">
        James Hancock is a creative website developer with a background in computer science 
        and innovation design. James presents the politics of the internet through striking 
        online experiences; from playing with the fundamental operations of the web browser 
        in labyr.in/th/, heâ€™s also created complex 3D scenes in fingerprint.garden and 
        you-are.online. His practice is focused on learning new technologies, preparing 
        him for future work in creative web development. James aims to keep a small digital 
        footprint, recognising the excessive quantities of content already available online. 
        All projects are made on a no-cost basis and are open-sourced for collaborators to 
        contribute to or steal from.
