        You Are Online is a website about how we engage with the modern internet. 
        You play the role of the Default User, a grey character working productively at a desk, 
        lost in the world of colours and experiences.
        However, as the User discovers, progress isn't always as great as it seems...

        <p className="showcase__paragraph">
        When we consume content online, we are distracted from the feelings of our body, leading us
        to forget our physical presence.
        Without this presence, our mind is held in the world of binary signals displayed by our screens.
        We are then carefully manipulated 
        by the creators of modern web services, who have invested heavily in making products 
        that trap our attention, keeping us entertained and engaged.

        This website reduces the participants humanity into a series of mindless interactions 
        for the website's algorithms, mirroring how humans engage in the attention economy of today.
        The human is just another object in the internet's codes and analytics; their body is discarded.
