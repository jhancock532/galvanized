          Your privacy is not respected in the digital realm. Personal data is being collected, 
          analysed, and sold. #Hashtag helps to highlight some of my feelings on the matter, 
          showing that even something as simple as a search can be exploited. In #Hashtag screens 
          that are normally used for advertisements are now showing your search results, though in 
          the real world, screens that usually show us information, are now starting to increasingly 
          show us adverts.

          I am a 3D artist specialising in hard surface, game friendly digital modelling. 
          With a background in front and back end programming, I try to combine my knowledge 
          of both disciplines to create detailed interactive experiences. My practice mostly 
          involves creating models and textures that are re-creations of real life objects, 
          and simplifying them for use in games and real time media. This has led me to study 
          perception, expectation and simplification, which I try to incorporate into my work. 
          Iâ€™m an advocate for privacy, and I do all my work using free and open source software.
