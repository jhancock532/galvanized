          Galvanised is an online exhibition displaying the work of 13 digital media artists completing their degrees at the University of Brighton.
          <br/><br/>
          The artists each come from different artistic and academic background, specialising in a variety of skills. 

          The show delivers a diverse range of creative practices, such as interactive virtual 
          installations, 3D environments, creative coding and machine learning.
          <br/><br/>
           Throughout the 
          last year, the artists have adapted to new and unconventional ways of working, as a 
          result of the pandemic. New challenges have provided new opportunities to consider the 
          way we interact with digital art, and Galvanised brings this together with a range of 
          immersive and interactive pieces.
